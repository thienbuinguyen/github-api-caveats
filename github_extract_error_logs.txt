is a sketch and some possible commented out v2 additions. I\'ve tried to come up with the most minimal API that\'s still extensible for future needs. At this point it seems better to have something than go many more years without. Unfortunately since the discussion around canvas is scattered all over the place I haven\'t been able to find that much background information and mostly used #1030 to inform myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n```webidl\\r\\npartial interface HTMLCanvasElement {\\r\\n  [SameObject] readonly attribute HitRegionSet regions;\\r\\n};\\r\\n\\r\\ninterface HitRegionSet {\\r\\n  void add(optional AddHitRegion options); // return HitRegion in the future\\r\\n  void clear();\\r\\n  void delete(Element target);\\r\\n  // void delete(HitRegion target);\\r\\n  // iterable<HitRegion>; IDL only allows this for objects with indexed getters?\\r\\n};\\r\\n\\r\\n// [Constructor(HTMLCanvasElement canvas, optional AddHitRegion options)]\\r\\n// interface HitRegion {\\r\\n//   [SameObject] readonly attribute HTMLCanvasElement canvas;\\r\\n//   [SameObject] readonly attribute Element target;\\r\\n//   Path2d getArea();\\r\\n// };\\r\\n\\r\\ndictionary AddHitRegion {\\r\\n  required Element target;\\r\\n  required Path2D area;\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting it on the `canvas` element directly makes the API suitable for 2D and WebGL, but the drawback is that it will be slightly more work for developers as we cannot take advantage of the current path and transformation as the initial proposal did.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea is basically that the hit regions are added in order, the last one added becoming topmost. Any UI events for the region go the region\'s element and do their usual thing from there (e.g., bubbling). This is basically a modification of the non-standardized hit testing algorithm. (I don\'t want to block this on getting that defined. We\'ll just use some words, add tests, and hope for the best.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the cursor I was thinking to use https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#resolved-value on the region\'s element (i.e., `getComputedStyle()`).\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @whatwg/canvas @whatwg/a11y @smaug----

Release Note\\r\\nSherpa now supports multiple versions of the XSPEC models from the 12.9.0 and 12.9.1 series. Some models recommend using the C-style interface over the older FORTRAN one, which may also resolve some memory access issues. For CIAO 4.10 users this means the interfaces to XSPEC models have been updated to the 12.9.1n versions. For Standalone Sherpa users this means they can build and run Sherpa against a larger range of XSPEC versions, and Sherpa will pick the XSPEC low level model function accordingly. Note that Sherpa has been tested against XSPEC 12.9.0i, 12.9.0o, and 12.9.1n.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Notes\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral models in XSPEC 12.9.1 have changed from a FORTRAN to C style interface. Can we support them?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first commit is actually just to see how working around the numpy version failure works and doesn\'t address the subject line. The second line supports conditional compilation for the compiled code - that is, it should build against XSPEC 12.9.0 and 12.9.1. However, the Python module code only supports a single version, which I have chosen to be 12.9.1.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there a way to make the function name depend on the XSPEC version? That is, for https://github.com/DougBurke/sherpa/blob/69fb779d8d09723ba235df0289047dd762472608/sherpa/astro/xspec/__init__.py#L531 make `__function__` depend on the XSPEC version? Something like\\r\\n\\r\\n    __function__ = if_at_least((12,9,1), \\"C_apec\\", \\"xsaped\\")\\r\\n\\r\\nI wasn\'t sure how this would interact with the new support for conditional compilation, which turned the value of the data stored `__function__` into a string rather than a symbol."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherpa/sherpa/issues/comments/364502850","html_url":"https://github.com/sherpa/sherpa/pull/428#issuecomment-364502850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sherpa/sherpa/issues/428","id":364502850,"user":{"login":"DougBurke","id":224638,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/224638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke","html_url":"https://github.com/DougBurke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DougBurke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-09T17:33:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-09T17:33:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code behind the XSPECMODELFCT_NORM/XSPECMODELFCT_C_NORM templates will fail to compile if you mix up the model type (i.e. send in a fortran style to the _C_ variant or C style to the other one). So if it compiles and runs on both XSPEC 12.9.0 and 12.9.1 then - unless we have lost one of the models - it should be fine. As you didn\'t have to touch the Python module (__init__.py) in the conflict resolution, then I think we also have evidence that you didn\'t miss a function (since the `__function__` names would end up causing an error when running the model [theoretically at least]."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-09T17:33:28Z","org":{"id":7264900,"login":"sherpa","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/sherpa","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7264900?"}}\n'}{'file':

-->\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Challenge Name\\r\\n[Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/react/learn-about-selfclosing-jsx-tags)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Issue Description\\r\\n<!-- Describe below when the issue happens and how to reproduce it -->\\r\\nRemoved the comments and closed the tags (Missed the br tag on first attempt failed then fixed) and then attempt failed but then the item rendered on the page.\\r\\n\\r\\nFail was from: The provided JSX element should render as is to the DOM node with id of challenge-node.\\r\\nItem was rendered on the preview when receiving this error. \\r\\nAppears it is being rendered not with challenge-node id but instead root id.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded code: ```ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById(\'challenge-node\'));```\\r\\nTests passed and now it renders twice on the preview.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Challenge states: \\r\\n> Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don\'t change any of the content - you only need to close tags where they are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not mention needing to attach it to the DOM and seems to indicate you only need to adjust the line-break and the horizontal-line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSolution:\\r\\nNeed to add directions to render to the DOM and remove the current preview.\\r\\nOr need to adjust the preview to be off of the challenge-node instead of the root id.\\r\\nOr there is another solution that I can not currently think of.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Your Code\\r\\n<!-- If relevant, paste all of your challenge code in here -->\\r\\n```js\\r\\nFailed:\\r\\nconst JSX = (\\r\\n  <div>\\r\\n    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2><br />\\r\\n    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>\\r\\n    <hr />\\r\\n

Over time, several useful features have been\\nported from CFQ as well (details in the changelog in README.BFQ). A\\n(bfq_)queue is associated to each task doing I/O on a device, and each\\ntime a scheduling decision has to be made a queue is selected and served\\nuntil it expires.\\n\\n    - Slices are given in the service domain: tasks are assigned\\n      budgets, measured in number of sectors.

Among queues in the same class the bandwidth is\\n      distributed in proportion to the weight of each queue.

There are two\\ntypical  cases: in the first  case,   processes  read  fixed-size chunks of\\ndata at a fixed distance from each other, while in the second case processes\\nmay read variable-size chunks at  variable distances. The latter case occurs\\nfor  example with  QEMU, which  splits the  I/O generated  by the  guest into\\nmultiple chunks,  and lets these chunks  be served by a  pool of cooperating\\nprocesses,  iteratively  assigning  the  next  chunk of  I/O  to  the first\\navailable  process. CFQ  uses actual  queue merging  for the  first type of\\nrocesses, whereas it  uses preemption to get a sequential  read pattern out\\nof the read requests  performed by the second type of  processes. In the end\\nit uses  two different  mechanisms to  achieve the  same goal: boosting the\\nthroughput with interleaved I/O.\\n\\nThis patch introduces  Early Queue Merge (EQM), a unified mechanism to get a\\nsequential  read pattern  with both  types of  processes. The  main idea is\\nchecking newly arrived requests against the next request of the active queue\\nboth in case of actual request insert and in case of request merge. By doing\\nso, both the types of processes can be handled by just merging their queues.\\nEQM is  then simpler and  more compact than the  pair of mechanisms used in\\nCFQ.\\n\\nFinally, EQM  also preserves the  typical low-latency properties of BFQ, by\\nproperly restoring the weight-raising state of a queue when it gets back to\\na non-merged state.\\n\\nSigned-off-by: Mauro Andreolini <mauro.andreolini@unimore.it>\\nSigned-off-by: Arianna Avanzini <avanzini.arianna@gmail.com>\\nSigned-off-by: Paolo Valente <paolo.valente@unimore.it>","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rahulsnair/android_kernel_motorola_msm8953/commits/8be7e6fd25034835cd86344b7cb60d25311c10a9"},{"sha":"782cffd50712d52daf5d5b185b74761e3636e9b5","author":{"name":"Alberto97","email":"64b2707298a0a8afed6e8730ee5b9a40007a9ed9@gmail.com"},"message":"arm/dt: addison: This is not just a charging LED!\\n\\nChange-Id: I123b6c59d96fcb531a79ee7b9a99502e27c0f85b","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rahulsnair/android_kernel_motorola_msm8953/commits/782cffd50712d52daf5d5b185b74761e3636e9b5"},{"sha":"8693a4ad050e556504c299d809e1fb5bda436295","author":{"name":"flar2","email":"50cb9bee76fd6567c3233b8a89e4a594c545792f@gmail.com"},"message":"homebutton: Use fingerprint sensor as homebutton\\n\\nThis driver will make the fingerprint sensor act as home button.\\n\\nAlso makes it configurable by apps such as Button Mapper\\n\\nChange-Id: Icf90a0fbe9134e8ac75853fb027e3c1f00351936\\nSuggested-by: tbalden <illespal@gmail.com>","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rahulsnair/android_kernel_motorola_msm8953/commits/8693a4ad050e556504c299d809e1fb5bda436295"},{"sha":"b2fbb906d7205478587dab0623aafb0f2bff64fe","author":{"name":"flar2","email":"50cb9bee76fd6567c3233b8a89e4a594c545792f@gmail.com"},"message":"homebutton: make key configurable","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rahulsnair/android_kernel_motorola_msm8953/commits/b2fbb906d7205478587dab0623aafb0f2bff64fe"},{"sha":"0df79980fa27ff70eb26f5b5bf538f00ec844b4a","author":{"name":"Alberto97","email":"64b2707298a0a8afed6e8730ee5b9a40007a9ed9@gmail.com"},"message":"homebutton: Remove Vibration\\n\\n* Android already vibrates when needed\\n\\nChange-Id: I844bc75fada88535df96460631dc3daae3f68e78","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rahulsnair/android_kernel_motorola_msm8953/commits/0df79980fa27ff70eb26f5b5bf538f00ec844b4a"},{"sha":"b24db67de6c078b63671b43197a35cdb8df32e09","author":{"name":"Deva Ramasubramanian","email":"8f8b6109cd5e7b75746932bf5dcf69e763e1f0b2@codeaurora.org"},"message":"media: Init the reserved fields of struct media_link_desc\\n\\nstruct media_link_desc is copy_to_user\'ed as the return value of\\nMEDIA_IOC_ENUM_LINKS.

For example, how can I start the game? The reason why a random new person is here. Or, at the end of the day, we all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr can I even run the game? We need to get finally stable in basic building and basic running of the game (aka. a lot can still be broken, but you can do _something_).\\r\\nRunning Inexor doesn\'t only needs to be possible but damn easy. This is was drives people away. This is what demotivates people the most.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s very hard to get it running for core members. When you don\'t even know yet if you like the project at all then you won\'t invest much time in debugging.\\r\\n\\r\\n____\\r\\n\\r\\n> Ideas for the different parts? Besides from \\"improving the docs\\" :D\\r\\n\\r\\nNext to **missing information**, we also have the problem of **duplicate and outdated information**. Please, please stop duplicating information. I\'m sure we have at least 5 places with the **same** basic information how to contribute to our project. This doesn\'t help, it\'s contra productive. And it won\'t get new contributors to us. An easy start into the application (aka. building and running) can hook people to the project because they like what they are seeing. No documentation on this planet can do this.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Completely** new people also don\'t care what we have planned. They care about the present state. \\r\\n\\r\\n(Our readme has some weird roadmap-ish thing, which I always considered missplaced, we also have milestones for release planing, we have now a flawed roadmap issue (definition of done? same function as milestones and the respective detail/implementation issue itself) and we have laid down in who-knows-how-many wiki pages what our vision overall is. => Information duplicated all over the place + the readme is the first thing new people see, they don\'t care about our future plan.)\\r\\n\\r\\n____\\r\\n\\r\\n**Working groups.**\\r\\nI don\'t like the idea. It\'s introducing hierarchy which we tried to avoid so far. And it\'s adding bureaucracy time in which nobody moves the project further. Also this idea isn\'t endless scalable nor very open to outsiders.\\r\\n\\r\\n@MartinMuzatko Honest question, why do you need to know **who** is doing what? In my opinion, when you want to contribute you should only need to know **HOW** and **WHERE**. It should be never required to know the internals of an existing team.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave a look at big repositories, apart from the core team nobody knows anyone.\\r\\nThis leads me to a more general point: I have sometimes the feeling like we treating this still as a small, closed down project. We should stop doing that.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody needs to know that I\'m making currently the biggest part of the CI. \\r\\nWhat is the place for suggestions? -> Issues. Anybody who has an opinion on something can comment. People who are actively involved in the part you are talking about, will comment for sure. If you open an issue about CI I will almost certainly comment on it.\\r\\nHow to contribute? -> Open a pull request. People who feel responsible for the project part you touched will get in touch with you for sure. (Of course this involves more like coding standards ect. but to be honest GitHub is placing an obvious message above pull requests, so there is no discovery-problem here).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s nice if we all have some form of personal contact as well and actually know each other, but this **CAN\'T** be a **requirement** for a truely open source project as this is **NOT** **scalable** and doable at all for big projects. And it is not required. Have a look at huge open source projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the answer to \\r\\n> I think it is important to know who to turn to, for these interest groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nis: GitHub issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n____\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing which I\'m missing is overall **consistency**. Being it with information (see my first two points) or how decisions are being made.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes issues are literally open for two years without a decision, others were sometimes only open for hours (or two days or another short time) before some decision was made by someone, preventing more people from commenting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same was true for pull requests in the past, but since we do require approvals in Core, Flex and media essentials this got much better here. I don\'t like at all to add bureaucracy to issues so I guess I don\'t want to add a completely formal process how decisions are made, but they should be long enough open to give everyone a fair chance to answer and there _**HAS TO(!)**_ be enough input. Obviously, what this means varies strongly. A huge decision about the creative direction should take a long time, because it has such huge and potential irreversible consequences (from a project view point), but a trivial bug fixing issue can be done in relatively short amount of time (if the fix implementation is non-controversial). This requires a good gut feeling and constant self-reflections about the gained experience from previous discussion/decision makings/implementations cycles.\\r\\n\\r\\n_**And when decisions are made:**_ And they should be made _**nowhere, except on GitHub issues**_, then they need to be replicable and documented. A complete stranger should still understand why and what decisions were made five years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was way too often that even I am didn\'t know about decisions for a (relative) long time and I literally read everything (all GitHub, all chat messages, all emails, all social media stuff.....) all the time from the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also noticed several times, that based on the feedback from few or even a single person, who discovered our project new, people started to **instantly** change readmes, wikis or other stuff. That would be okay, if we have actually learned something new from the feedback and would continue doing things in this specific new way, but often it was like a one-time-thing. For me, that looks impulsive. More consistency, please?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust one small-ish example: Remember when we wanted to have a wiki template because people were thinking our wiki is a mess? Pretty much every new wiki page doesn\'t use it anymore. Is this good or bad? Who knows. But it\'s definitely inconsistent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m sure we would actually drive faster when we take more time for considerations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-19T19:07:22Z","org":{"id":5883878,"login":"inexorgame","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/inexorgame","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5883878?"}}\n'}{'file':

\\r\\n\\r\\n> Its sad when lint has a flexible standard and a formatter tool cant be just as flexible and down right rude about it\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, that\'s pretty much why we oppose adding options for everything. A lint can be as flexible as you want (it can even let you add your own rules, for that matter) because it will just complain if it finds something that doesn\'t \\"comply\\" with the rules. A formatter though has to format every single piece of code consistently and correctly, and adding options means adding overhead to maintainers: more code, a bigger surface for bugs, tests increase exponentially to check different combination of options, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t understand your claim that we don\'t care about other developers, if that was the case we wouldn\'t bother doing unpaid work to maintain this tool. And I also didn\'t find anything rude in this thread, other than your comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n> every developer should be able to configure their project how ever they like\\r\\n\\r\\nI completely agree with this. Developers have the option of using Prettier or not, and configuring the options Prettier has. That doesn\'t mean we have the obligation to support every JavaScript style out there. Also, the fact this issue was opened by one of the maintainers (and wasn\'t yet close) mean we\'re open for discussion and might be willing to support an option if there\'s significant demand for it (as we have done in the past).\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are also free to use whatever tools available to have a better developer experience, it\'s great that we have so many quality tools available, for free! We believe Prettier does a great job in that, and if you disagree, we\'re always open to talk and maybe meet halfway."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-22T19:16:03Z","org":{"id":25822731,"login":"prettier","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/prettier","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25822731?"}}\n'}{'file':

branch rebases #1128 against current master and refines options somewhat and CLAGS as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor changes against #1128:\\r\\n * use g_path_basename() instead of a const basename()

configure.ac\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not yet sure if travis should run with --enable-extra-warnings, it bloats the build log.

and p5js are designed to be accessible to newcomers to coding, especially artists who have never coded before.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason I make 3 suggestions for language design changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are arrived at as a result of writing (in progress) a book which aims to introduce algorithmic concepts and processing/p5js coding to complete beginners, and also first hand [experience](https://www.meetup.com/Algorithmic-Art/events/238262335/) of teaching complete beginners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are: \\r\\n1. **circle()** and **square()** aliases for ellipse() and rect()\\r\\n2. easier loops eg **repeat 5 {}** as an alternative to the java/javascript structure\\r\\n3. random integer generator, perhaps making **random()** for **integers** and **randomf()** for floats, leading to the conventional randomn() for gaussian noise, etc \\r\\n\\r\\nI have written a more detailed rationale here:

- thanks for your thoughts, and also understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree with your suggestion is great. An additional library wouldn\'t break the existing p5js and wouldn\'t upset those who want to keep such ideas out of the core.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have on suggestion in response to yours - rather than a develop centric approach to developing a p5.kids library - we apply a filter for every suggestion to ensure that the proposals are based o actual user research. I\'m sure this can be done proportionately - even a set of observations that \\"ellipse\\" scares people away but \\"circle\\" does not .. or the observation over several classes that kids are finding it tough to get over \\"int(random())\\". That way all features have a rationale and basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the coming months I will get more experience with teaching younger people, and also non-technical artists, some who have never coded before .. and I hope to write down my learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks everyone who commented.

\\r\\n`package.json`:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\"scripts\\": {\\r\\n        ...\\r\\n      },\\r\\n      \\"proxy\\": \\"http://localhost:3001\\"\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\nSo as you can see it\'s [simple proxy as described in documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#proxying-api-requests-in-development).\\r\\nOn the backend side (port `3001`) we call another APIs (another rest services). \\r\\nI have noticed that proxy calls from webpack (create-react-app) to express (backed) during development are really slow. (we work on Windows OS)\\r\\n\\r\\n    GET http://localhost:3000/endpoint/ -> ~600ms - 900ms (webpack -> express -> 3rd party rest api)\\r\\n    GET http://localhost:3001/endpoint/ -> ~150ms - 250ms (express -> 3rd party rest api)\\r\\n    GET http://restAPI:XYZ/endpoint/    -> ~150ms - 250ms (3rd party rest api direct call)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see the time differences between proxy calls (port 3000) and direct calls - port (3001) - are really huge. I expected delay but this looks weird.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso **sometimes large JSON response (`~38KB`) from proxy is broken** (invalid - e.g missing some parts of a response or swapped characters). I have been struggling with the same issue on backend side and *I think I have resolved it with proxy-agent where I set `keep-alive` connection.* \\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you have any idea why or how to improve proxy time and behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso I tried to set agent in `package.json` but without success.\\r\\n[create react app documentation][2]  says:\\r\\n\\r\\n> You may also specify any configuration value http-proxy-middleware or http-proxy supports.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd [http-proxy documentation][3] says\\r\\n\\r\\n> agent: object to be passed to http(s).request (see Node\'s https agent\\r\\n> and http agent objects)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Is it possible to define agent in `package.json`?**\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried but I got following error\\r\\n\\r\\n> TypeError: Agent option must be an Agent-like object, undefined, or\\r\\n> false.\\r\\n>     at new ClientRequest (_http_client.js:106:11)\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\"proxy\\": {\\r\\n        \\"/\\": {\\r\\n          \\"target\\": \\"http://localhost:3001\\",\\r\\n          \\"agent\\": { \\"keepAlive\\": true }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      }\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly appreciate any suggestion or idea. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/06/react-web-express-api-development-production/\\r\\n  [2]: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#configuring-the-proxy-manually\\r\\n  [3]: https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#options\\r\\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/create-react-app/issues/comments/370174150","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/4086#issuecomment-370174150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/create-react-app/issues/4086","id":370174150,"user":{"login":"VladoDemcak","id":5232606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5232606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak","html_url":"https://github.com/VladoDemcak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladoDemcak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-03T19:41:23Z","updated_at":"2018-03-03T19:41:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We are forced to use [react-app-rewired][1] for custom agent.

user-goal for MapStories is to have the option to play a story from start to end without requiring user intervention. This would allow, for example, a story to be played on a continuous loop in a museum or display. \\n\\nThe \\"loop story\\" functions allows this right now. BUT, stories with storypins that have embedded videos cannot automatically play those videos unless a user is there to pause the story and click \\"play\\" on the video.\\n\\nThis issue is a feature enhancement issue to investigate a method that lets a video in a storypin be automatically played if \\"loop story\\" is selected. Ideally, there would also be a method for defining the points in the video the video would start and end at (so, for example, if a video is 30 minutes but only 5 minutes desire to be used, the auto start and end could be defined to show that 5 minutes)"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MapStory/mapstory/issues/comments/436795548","html_url":"https://github.com/MapStory/mapstory/issues/1520#issuecomment-436795548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MapStory/mapstory/issues/1520","id":436795548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjc5NTU0OA==","user":{"login":"j-meyer","id":205525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/205525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer","html_url":"https://github.com/j-meyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-meyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-07T22:07:43Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T22:07:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

the time of writing in `master`, and in the v0.12.0-alpha1 build, we have partially-implemented support for auto-installing providers via the Terraform Registry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is currently lacking a mechanism to filter plugins by supported protocol version, and so the alpha1 build and any other builds made before this is fixed will see `terraform init` seem to successfully install plugins that are not actually compatible:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n$ terraform init\\r\\n\\r\\nInitializing provider plugins...\\r\\n- Checking for available provider plugins...\\r\\n- Downloading plugin for provider \\"http\\" (1.0.1)...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,\\r\\nso the latest version was installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking\\r\\nchanges, it is recommended to add version = \\"...\\" constraints to the\\r\\ncorresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings\\r\\nsuggested below.\\r\\n\\r\\n* provider.http: version = \\"~> 1.0\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTerraform has been successfully initialized!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \\"terraform plan\\" to see\\r\\nany changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands\\r\\nshould now work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,\\r\\nrerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other\\r\\ncommands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n...but then any follow-up command will produce a compatibility error:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n$ terraform apply\\r\\n\\r\\nError: Failed to instantiate provider \\"http\\" to obtain schema: Incompatible API version with plugin.

Understanding contributors\\n\\nMost contributors take a gradual path to getting involved in an open source community. It usually looks something like this: \\n\\n1. Reporting a bug\\n1. Suggesting a new feature\\n1. Creating a pull request\\n\\nMore seasoned open source contributors might go straight to creating their first pull request, so adding helpful templates to a repository that makes it easier for _everyone_ to get involved, regardless of their previous experience. \\n\\n## Step 6: Adding an issue template\\n\\nWhen you add an issue template and pull request template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template\'s contents when they open a new issue or pull request. Templates help you standardize the information you\'d like included when contributors open issues.\\n\\n### Creating multiple templates\\n\\nIn open source projects, templates make it easy for new contributors to create bug reports, suggest new features, or contribute changes. Mona has already created an issue template for new, can you put one together for bugs?\\n\\n### :keyboard: Activity: Adding an issue template\\n\\n1. Access the [**Code**](https://github.com/joelibaceta/community-starter-kit/) tab of your project\\n1. Be sure to select the `add-issue-template` branch from the branch dropdown\\n1. Click the **Create new file** button\\n1. Create a file in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder named `bug-report.md` (you can do this by typing `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md` in the file name field)\\n1. Include headings and placeholders for the information you want to collect when a user creates a bug report\\n1. After editing the template file, scroll down and click the **Commit new file**\\n\\n<hr>\\n<h3 align=\\"center\\">Watch below for my response!</h3>\\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelibaceta/community-starter-kit/issues/comments/438523378","html_url":"https://github.com/joelibaceta/community-starter-kit/pull/4#issuecomment-438523378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joelibaceta/community-starter-kit/issues/4","id":438523378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODUyMzM3OA==","user":{"login":"github-learning-lab[bot]","id":37936606,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzc5MzY2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/in/10572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-learning-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-learning-lab%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-14T03:18:42Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T03:18:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Step 7: Merge the issue template\\n\\nThese issue templates are going to help users become contributors in no time!

Any sort of signalk API to manage these will broaden the scope of signalk and make compliant servers difficult to provide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes more sense to create stand-alone programs (call them Bots) that subscribe to the signalk server and perform these updates/actions, rather than being part of the server. That would allow then to be written in any convenient language and added to any server installation. It simplifies the signalk server implementation, and allows wider contributions from the community. The Bots could be made available in an app store, like we do with web-apps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time we should make a specific decision to limit the scope of the signalk specification to the data model and access/modification/etc of it. eg it maintains and notifies the state of the vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SignalK/specification/issues/comments/440781071","html_url":"https://github.com/SignalK/specification/issues/524#issuecomment-440781071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SignalK/specification/issues/524","id":440781071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDc4MTA3MQ==","user":{"login":"rob42","id":3239261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzkyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3239261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42","html_url":"https://github.com/rob42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-21T19:20:01Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T19:20:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Bots will mostly need a full programming language, but that may be python, perl, or whatever. they can also be built into the server itself, makes sense for true wind and XTE, since those are \'well known\' requirements.

`GatewayMetaState` is capable of atomically storing `MetaData` to\\r\\ndisk. We\'ve also moved fields that are needed to be persisted in Zen2\\r\\nfrom `ClusterState` to `ClusterState.MetaData.CoordinationMetaData`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR implements `PersistedState` interface. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. `version` and `currentTerm` are persisted as a part of `Mainfest`.\\r\\n2. `GatewayMetaState` now have two descendants `Zen1GatewayMetaState`\\r\\nand `Zen2GatewayMetaState` (which implements `PersistedState`).\\r\\n3. `GatewayMetaState` now constructs `previousClusterState` (including\\r\\n`MetaData`) and `previousManifest` inside the constructor, so that all\\r\\n`PersistedState` methods are usable as soon as `GatewayMetaState`\\r\\ninstance is constructed. Also `loadMetaData` is renamed to\\r\\n`getMetaData`, because it just returns\\r\\n`previousClusterState.metaData()`.\\r\\n4. Currently when deciding whether to write `IndexMetaData` to disk,\\r\\nwe\'re comparing current `IndexMetaData` version and received\\r\\n`IndexMetaData` version. This is not safe in Zen2 if term has changed.\\r\\nSo `updateClusterState` now accepts `writeWithoutComparingVersion`\\r\\nmethod parameter. When it\'s set to true, we always write\\r\\n`IndexMetaData` to disk. \\r\\n5. Things that are not covered by `GatewayMetaStateTests` are covered\\r\\nby `Zen2GatewayMetaStateTests`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR does not inject `Zen2GatewayMetaState` in place of\\r\\n`Zen1GatewayMetaState` and in place of `InMemoryPersistedState`, this\\r\\nis a work to be done in a follow-up

for amd64, arm32v6, arm64v8\\r\\n\\r\\nHai all,\\r\\n\\r\\nI just succeeded to build ARM32v6, ARM64v8 and AMD64 images for EMQX 3.0-rc.4. These images are based on Alpine 3.8 and Erlang 21.1.3 and includes tzdata #70 & #75\\r\\n\\r\\nTo build these images from Travis, please sent an email to **support@travis-ci.com** to request to  increase the overall timeout! This is default set to 50 minutes and needs to be extended to at least 120 minutes!!! The build runs 3 jobs parallel, each for one image (arm32v6, arm64v8, amd64). The arm32v6 and arm64v8 take about 120 minutes to build, while amd64 takes about 15 minutes. This is because arm gets emulated by qemu and is slower. The final step is to create and push the manifest lists for these images. When using manifest list for your docker images there is no need to tag the image, since the images are manifest listed, which means, docker detect the architecture and pulls corresponding image automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowto release:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. modify EMQX_VERSION and/or OTP_VERSION in .travis.yml\\r\\n2. if needed modify  OTP_DOWNLOAD_SHA256 in Dockerfile.alpine-tmpl\\r\\n3. create a github release with a tag like:\\r\\n- v3.0-rc.4\\r\\n- v3.0-rc.4-testing\\r\\n- v3.0-rc.4-beta\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Docker.sh script check for testing and beta in the build version, if it exists it will create associated manifest list for it and leaves latest tag untouched.\\r\\n\\r\\nFind below an example of a docker compose file I use to deployed with docker stack (note TZ is not used yet):\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n################################################################################\\r\\n# MQTT Stack\\r\\n################################################################################\\r\\n#$ docker stack deploy mqtt --compose-file docker-compose-mqtt.yml\\r\\n################################################################################\\r\\nversion: \\"3.6\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nservices:\\r\\n  emqx-master:\\r\\n    image: emqx/emqx\\r\\n    hostname: emqx-master\\r\\n    environment:\\r\\n      - \\"EMQX_NAME=emq\\"\\r\\n      - \\"EMQX_HOST=master.mq.tt\\"\\r\\n      - \\"EMQX_NODE__COOKIE=ef16498f66804df1cc6172f6996d5492\\"\\r\\n      - \\"EMQX_WAIT_TIME=60\\"\\r\\n    networks:\\r\\n      emqx-net:\\r\\n        aliases:\\r\\n          - master.mq.tt\\r\\n    volumes:\\r\\n      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro\\r\\n      - /etc/timezone:/etc/TZ:ro\\r\\n    deploy:\\r\\n      placement:\\r\\n        constraints: [node.role == manager]\\r\\n\\r\\n  emqx-worker:\\r\\n    image: emqx/emqx\\r\\n    hostname: emqx-worker\\r\\n    environment:\\r\\n      - \\"EMQX_JOIN_CLUSTER=emq@master.mq.tt\\"\\r\\n      - \\"EMQX_NODE__COOKIE=ef16498f66804df1cc6172f6996d5492\\"\\r\\n      - \\"EMQX_WAIT_TIME=60\\"\\r\\n    depends_on:\\r\\n     - emqx-master\\r\\n    networks:\\r\\n      - emqx-net\\r\\n    volumes:\\r\\n      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro\\r\\n      - /etc/timezone:/etc/TZ:ro\\r\\n    deploy:\\r\\n      placement:\\r\\n        constraints: [node.role == worker]\\r\\n      \\r\\nnetworks:\\r\\n  emqx-net:\\r\\n    external: false\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHope you appreciate all the work and don\'t hesitate to contact me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegards,\\r\\nRaymond"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emqx/emqx-docker/issues/comments/444760463","html_url":"https://github.com/emqx/emqx-docker/pull/91#issuecomment-444760463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emqx/emqx-docker/issues/91","id":444760463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDc2MDQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"RaymondMouthaan","id":25717738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE3NzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25717738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan","html_url":"https://github.com/RaymondMouthaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RaymondMouthaan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T06:13:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-06T06:13:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The earlier reason of failure was indeed the EMQX_DEPS_DEFAULT_VSN env variable.

Only the consumed (or destructively read) _named_ reference loses its alias which is transferred to the ephemeral reference. I [understand](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-tutorial/issues/322#issuecomment-445145936) that the ephemeral reference is unnamed until it is assigned to a name, but non-exclusive reference capability types may have aliases other than the ephemeral reference.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps George intended to write \xe2\x80\x98reference\xe2\x80\x99 instead of \xe2\x80\x98value\xe2\x80\x99?

:wave: Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab\'s \\"Introduction to GitHub\\"\\n\\nTo get started, I\xe2\x80\x99ll guide you through some important first steps in coding and collaborating on GitHub.\\n\\n:point_down: _This arrow means you can expand the window! Click on them throughout the course to find more information._\\n<details><summary>What is GitHub?</summary>\\n<hr>\\n\\n## What is GitHub?\\n\\nI\'m glad you asked! Many people come to GitHub because they want to contribute to open source <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#open-source)</sup> projects, or they\'re invited by teammates or classmates who use it for their projects. Why do people use GitHub for these projects?\\n\\n**At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**\\n\\nFrom software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.\\n\\n**GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**\\n\\nGitHub uses Git <sup>[definition](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup>, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor)</sup> to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.\\n\\n**GitHub helps people do much more.**\\n\\nGitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you\'re visualizing data or building a new game, there\'s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we\'ll dig into the rest later!\\n\\n:tv: [Video: What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)\\n<hr>\\n</details><br>\\n\\n<details><summary>Exploring a GitHub repository</summary>\\n<hr>\\n\\n## Exploring a GitHub repository\\n\\n:tv: [Video: Exploring a repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw)\\n\\n### More features\\n\\nThe video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:\\n\\n- Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub\\n- Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation\\n- Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:\\n  - Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that\xe2\x80\x99s in-progress in this project dashboard\\n  - Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work\\n\\n### Special Files\\n\\nIn the video you learned about a special file called the README.md. Here are a few other special files you can add to your repositories:\\n\\n- CONTRIBUTING.md: The `CONTRIBUTING.md` is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.\\n- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.\\n\\n<hr>\\n</details>\\n\\n### Using issues\\n\\nThis is an issue <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issue)</sup>: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.\\n\\nIssue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.\\n\\n\\n<details><summary>Using GitHub Issues</summary>\\n\\n## Using GitHub issues\\n\\nIssues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:\\n\\n- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place\\n- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>\\n- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions\\n- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions\\n\\n:tv: [Video: Using issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhj46r5D0nQ)\\n\\n<hr>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details><summary>Managing notifications</summary>\\n<hr>\\n\\n## Managing notifications\\n\\n:tv: [Video: Watching, notifications, stars, and explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQldxF7fMY)\\n\\nOnce you\'ve commented on an issue or pull request, you\'ll start receiving email notifications when there\'s activity in the thread.  \\n\\n### How to silence or unmute specific conversations\\n\\n1. Go to the issue or pull request\\n2. Under _\\"Notifications\\"_, click the **Unsubscribe** button on the right to silence notifications or **Subscribe** to unmute them\\n\\nYou\'ll see a short description that explains your current notification status.\\n\\n### How to customize notifications in Settings\\n\\n1. Click your profile icon\\n2. Click **Settings**\\n3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left and [adjust your notification preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/)\\n\\n### Repository notification options\\n\\n* **Watch**: You\'ll receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is posted, and when an issue is closed or a pull request is merged  \\n* **Not watching**: You\'ll no longer receive notifications unless you\'re @-mentioned\\n* **Ignore**: You\'ll no longer receive any notifications from the repository\\n\\n### How to review notifications for the repositories you\'re watching\\n\\n1. Click your profile icon\\n2. Click **Settings**\\n3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left\\n4. Click on the [repositories you\xe2\x80\x99re watching](https://github.com/watching) link\\n5. Select the **Watching** tab\\n6.

DROOLS-3344\\r\\n\\r\\nSee https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DROOLS-3344\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR introduces two king of enhancements: **I) The introduction of keyboard shortcuts** in the Data Types tab, and **II) Visual changes** to clarify some concepts to the user.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Keyboard shortcuts:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Navigation based on arrows:\\r\\nNow users can use <kbd>\xe2\x86\x91</kbd> and <kbd>\xe2\x86\x93</kbd> to navigate between Data Types, and expand/collapse by using <kbd>\xe2\x86\x92</kbd>/<kbd>\xe2\x86\x90</kbd>, respectively:\\r\\n![navigation-arrows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1079279/50112353-2ee0ad80-0226-11e9-9515-82440b92e7b6.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, when users are searching for some DT, they can just press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate in the results (ahh.. but they can press <kbd>\xe2\x86\x93</kbd> to go to the first result too):\\r\\n![tab-arrows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1079279/50112352-2ee0ad80-0226-11e9-804a-c6dc0cd1d4da.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW.. the navigation can be disabled by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Updating Data Types:\\r\\nWhen users want to update a Data Type, they just need to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> to activate the edit mode, and then, they can save the changes by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>:\\r\\n![edit-mode-dtrl-e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1079279/50112351-2ee0ad80-0226-11e9-9bf8-c203afe6166a.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if they don\'t want to update anything, they can close the edit mode by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>:\\r\\n![edit-mode-by-esc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1079279/50112349-2e481700-0226-11e9-8a76-fca903573aff.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Creating Data Types:\\r\\nNow the flow for creating Data Types is improved to avoid the use of the mouse. When users want to create a nested DT, they can just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> for a DT above, or even <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> for a DT below:\\r\\n![many-things-creation-easy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1079279/50112350-2ee0ad80-0226-11e9-9478-7d2f9043b424.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### List of shortcuts:\\r\\n<kbd>\xe2\x86\x91</kbd> - Go to the next Data Type\\r\\n<kbd>\xe2\x86\x93</kbd> - Go to the previous Data Type\\r\\n<kbd>\xe2\x86\x92</kbd> - Expand the Data Type\\r\\n<kbd>\xe2\x86\x90</kbd> - Collapse the Data Type\\r\\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> - Activate edit mode\\r\\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> - Save the Data Type\\r\\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +

Thanks for the feedback!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a good point about race conditions, and those while loops potentially not terminating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intent of this SEP is that in the general case, if there\'s an error with the funding transaction, the issuer should just fail and return funds to the user. No retries. So that\'s how the account merged race condition would be handled, as well as the case of a trustline being removed. If a user does something like merging an account or removing a trustline at the same time they have a pending deposit, it\'s pretty unclear what result the user wants. It may even be they are making an effort to cancel the deposit. As a result, failing the deposit and refunding seems like the best approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only case where an issuer should retry is this case: \\r\\n\\r\\n> In case 1, a third party creates U before Isabel\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in that case, the issuer retries only once before giving up.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me know if that helps address those concerns.
